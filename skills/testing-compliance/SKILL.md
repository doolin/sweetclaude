# Testing Compliance

Track compliance control status, log evidence, and surface gaps. Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Routing

| Arguments | Operation |
|---|---|
| (empty) or `status` | → **Status** — overall compliance coverage |
| `assess <standard>` | → **Assess** — gap analysis for a standard |
| `log <control-id>` | → **Log evidence** for a control |
| `report` | → **Generate** gap report |
| `init <standard>` | → **Initialize** tracking for a new standard |

Valid standard names: `soc2`, `hipaa`, `gdpr`, `pci_dss`

---

## Status

Use `COMPLIANCE_NOT_FOUND` or compliance state from shell block.

If `COMPLIANCE_NOT_FOUND`: "No compliance tracking initialized. Run `testing-compliance init <standard>` to start."

Otherwise present:

```
Compliance Status
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

SOC 2 (Security TSC)
  Tested:           12 / 34 controls
  Evidence logged:   9 / 12 tested
  Gaps:              3 controls with no mitigation

GDPR
  Tested:            6 / 18 controls
  Evidence logged:   4 / 6 tested
  Gaps:              7 controls not started
```

---

## Init

Arguments: `init <standard>`

Ask: "Which Trust Service Categories / modules apply?"

**SOC 2:** Security (required) + optional: Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy

**HIPAA:** Administrative Safeguards, Physical Safeguards, Technical Safeguards

**GDPR:** Lawful Basis & Consent, Data Subject Rights, Data Minimization, Security & Breach, DPO & Documentation, International Transfers

**PCI-DSS:** All 12 requirements (ask which apply based on card data scope)

Load the control set for the selected modules. Write to compliance.yaml:

```bash
python3 - <<'PYEOF'
import yaml
from datetime import datetime

# Load existing or create new
try:
    with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml') as f:
        state = yaml.safe_load(f) or {}
except FileNotFoundError:
    state = {'schema_version': 1, 'standards': {}}

# Add new standard with controls
# <standard> and controls populated from control catalog below
state['standards']['<standard>'] = {
    'initialized_at': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
    'modules': ['<selected modules>'],
    'controls': {
        '<control-id>': {
            'title': '<control title>',
            'status': 'not_started',
            'evidence': [],
            'notes': None
        }
        # ... all controls
    }
}

with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml', 'w') as f:
    yaml.dump(state, f, default_flow_style=False, allow_unicode=True)
print('ok')
PYEOF
```

Confirm: `Initialized {standard} — {N} controls loaded`

## Assess

Arguments: `assess <standard>`

Load controls from compliance.yaml. For each control not yet `tested` or `not_applicable`:

Present one control at a time:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
Control CC6.1 — Logical access security

  Authentication implemented for all user-facing systems.

  Status:  not_started

  Questions to assess:
    1. Is authentication required for all access to protected resources?
    2. What authentication mechanism is in use?
    3. Is there a password policy or equivalent?
    4. Are privileged accounts using stronger controls (MFA)?
```

Wait for user response. Classify result:

- **Pass** — control is implemented, evidence exists or can be collected
- **Partial** — control partially implemented, gaps identified
- **Gap** — control not implemented, risk accepted or remediation needed
- **N/A** — control does not apply (must give reason)

```bash
python3 - <<'PYEOF'
import yaml
from datetime import datetime

with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml') as f:
    state = yaml.safe_load(f)

state['standards']['<standard>']['controls']['<control-id>']['status'] = '<pass|partial|gap|na>'
state['standards']['<standard>']['controls']['<control-id>']['notes'] = '<assessment notes>'
state['standards']['<standard>']['controls']['<control-id>']['assessed_at'] = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml', 'w') as f:
    yaml.dump(state, f, default_flow_style=False, allow_unicode=True)
print('ok')
PYEOF
```

For `gap` status: ask "File a remediation issue?" On yes — create a project issue:

```bash
source ~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/sc-artifact.sh
sc_artifact_create issue '{
  "title": "Compliance gap: <control title>",
  "type": "story",
  "status": "backlog",
  "priority": "sooner",
  "description": "<gap description and remediation approach>",
  "tags": ["compliance", "<standard>", "<control-id>"]
}'
```

---

## Log Evidence

Arguments: `log <control-id>`

Ask:
1. "What evidence exists for this control? (description)"
2. "Where is it stored? (file path, URL, or description)"
3. "Date of evidence?"

```bash
python3 - <<'PYEOF'
import yaml
from datetime import datetime

with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml') as f:
    state = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Find the control across all standards
for std_name, std_data in state['standards'].items():
    if '<control-id>' in std_data.get('controls', {}):
        ctrl = std_data['controls']['<control-id>']
        if 'evidence' not in ctrl:
            ctrl['evidence'] = []
        ctrl['evidence'].append({
            'description': '<description>',
            'location': '<location>',
            'date': '<date>',
            'logged_at': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        })
        break

with open('.sweetclaude/state/compliance.yaml', 'w') as f:
    yaml.dump(state, f, default_flow_style=False, allow_unicode=True)
print('ok')
PYEOF
```

Confirm: `Evidence logged for <control-id>`

---

## Report

Generate a gap report for all initialized standards.

```
Compliance Gap Report — {date}
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

SOC 2 — Security TSC
  Pass:           18 controls
  Partial:         4 controls
  Gap:             3 controls
  Not applicable:  5 controls
  Not assessed:    4 controls

  Gaps requiring remediation:
    CC7.1  Vulnerability scanning — no automated scan in place
    CC9.2  Vendor risk management — no vendor review process
    CC8.1  Change management — deploys not logged or reviewed

  Partial controls:
    CC6.1  Authentication — MFA not enforced for admin accounts
    ...

GDPR
  ...

Open remediation issues: {N}
  I-042  Compliance gap: CC7.1 Vulnerability scanning    priority: sooner
  I-043  Compliance gap: CC9.2 Vendor risk management    priority: later
```

If saving: write to `.sweetclaude/testing/compliance-report-{date}.md`.

---

## Rules

- Gaps must have a remediation issue or a documented risk acceptance. Neither is optional — "we know about it" is not a status.
- N/A requires a documented reason. Challenge N/A on controls that seem applicable.
- Evidence location is required for `pass` controls at audit time. Prompt for it if missing.
- Compliance state is sensitive. It lives in `.sweetclaude/state/` — always private, never committed to public repos.
- This skill supports compliance preparation — it does not constitute a formal audit. Always confirm with a qualified auditor before making compliance claims to customers.
