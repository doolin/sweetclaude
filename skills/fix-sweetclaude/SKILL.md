# SweetClaude Fix Config

Audit this project's SweetClaude setup. Fix what is broken.

**This skill changes SweetClaude configuration, not project code. Every change is proposed before applied.**

---

## Step 0: Check for YAML parse failure

If called because `sweetclaude.yaml` failed to parse (the `/sweetclaude` orchestrator routes here on parse error), run:

```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml
try:
    yaml.safe_load(open('.sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml'))
    print('YAML_OK')
except yaml.YAMLError as e:
    print(f'YAML_ERROR: {e}')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('YAML_MISSING')
" 2>/dev/null
```

If `YAML_ERROR`, show the problematic area:
```bash
python3 -c "
import yaml
try:
    yaml.safe_load(open('.sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml'))
except yaml.YAMLError as e:
    if hasattr(e, 'problem_mark'):
        m = e.problem_mark
        lines = open('.sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml').readlines()
        start = max(0, m.line - 2)
        end = min(len(lines), m.line + 3)
        for i, l in enumerate(lines[start:end], start+1):
            marker = ' <<<' if i == m.line+1 else ''
            print(f'{i:3}: {l.rstrip()}{marker}')
    else:
        print(str(e))
" 2>/dev/null
```

> "Your \`sweetclaude.yaml\` has a syntax error at the line marked above. Most common cause: a manual edit introduced bad indentation or a special character."

Options for the user:
1. **Fix it for me** → attempt auto-repair: run `sweetclaude:_migrate` (will rebuild from archived files if present)
2. **Show me the file** → `cat .sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml`
3. **Restore from archive** → copy archive back and re-migrate:
   ```bash
   cp .sweetclaude/state/archive/phase.yaml.bak .sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml 2>/dev/null || true
   cp .sweetclaude/state/archive/skills.yaml.bak .sweetclaude/state/skills.yaml 2>/dev/null || true
   rm -f .sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml
   ```
   Then invoke `sweetclaude:_migrate`.

If `YAML_OK`, proceed to the existing steps below (the YAML is fine — the issue is something else).
If `YAML_MISSING`, say: "Looks like the config file is missing entirely. Let me set things up." Then invoke `sweetclaude:setup`.

---

## Step 1: Check .sweetclaude/ state exists

If neither `.sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml` nor `.sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml` exists:
> "SweetClaude is not set up for this project. Ask me to set it up."

Stop. Do not proceed.

---

## Step 2: Audit phase state vs reality

If `.sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml` does not exist (project is on the new `sweetclaude.yaml` schema), skip this step entirely.

Read `.sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml`. Then assess the actual project state:

1. Check git log — how many commits? How recent? What kind of work?
2. Check for implementation artifacts — source code, tests, builds
3. Check for product artifacts — PRD, product brief, specs, stories
4. Check for design artifacts — architecture docs, tech specs, ADRs
5. Check for strategy artifacts — concept, pain thesis, competitive analysis

Compare what the phase says vs what actually exists:

| phase.yaml says | Project actually has | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| DISCOVER | Substantial code, tests, deployed | Phase is stale — should be IMPLEMENT or later |
| DISCOVER | PRD and architecture but no code | Phase should be PLAN or DESIGN |
| IMPLEMENT | Only a concept doc | Phase is ahead of reality |

If phase does not match reality, propose the correction:
> "phase.yaml says {current}. The project is actually in {recommended} based on: {evidence}. Update?"

---

## Step 3: Audit CLAUDE.md

Read the project's CLAUDE.md. Check:

1. **Repo structure section** — does it list directories that actually exist? Does it omit directories that do exist?
   - `ls` key directories and compare against what CLAUDE.md claims
   - Flag: directories listed but missing, directories that exist but are not listed

2. **Build/test/lint commands** — are they accurate?
   - Check package.json scripts, Makefile, pyproject.toml against what CLAUDE.md says
   - Try running the test command to see if it works

3. **SweetClaude section** — is it present and correct?
   - Should reference `.sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml`
   - Should have the pre-flight invocation instruction
   - Should NOT reference a "working repo"

4. **Project description** — is it still accurate?

For each issue found, propose a specific fix:
> "CLAUDE.md says {wrong thing}. Actual: {right thing}. Fix?"

---

## Step 4: Audit file locations

Check that artifacts are where SweetClaude expects them:

| Expected Location | Check |
|---|---|
| `.sweetclaude/state/` | phase.yaml, project.yaml, skills.yaml, decision-log, assumption-register, improvement-register, scope-changes |
| `docs/` | product-brief, prd, architecture, tech-spec, data-model, api-design, workflows (if they exist anywhere in the project) |
| `.sweetclaude/stories/` | user stories and .feature files (if they exist) |
| `.sweetclaude/backlog/` | BACKLOG-INDEX.md and item detail files (if product-parking-lot has been used) |
| `.sweetclaude/milestones/` | milestone detail files (if product-milestones has been used) |
| `.sweetclaude/sprints/` | sprint files (if product-sprint-plan has been used) |
| `.sweetclaude/traceability/` | requirements-map, ripple-map |
| `strategy/` | concept, pain-thesis, ICP, competitive, etc. (at project root, NOT inside .sweetclaude/) |

If artifacts exist but in the wrong location (e.g., specs at `.sweetclaude/specs/` instead of `docs/`):

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- "Move it" — relocate {artifact} from {actual location} to {expected location}
- "Symlink it" — create a link at {expected location} pointing to {actual location}
- "Leave it" — update SweetClaude's reference to look at {actual location}

Do not assume. The user may have good reasons for the current location.

---

## Step 5: Audit skills.yaml and onboarding state

**5a: Resolve base_path**

Read `.sweetclaude/artifact-privacy.yaml` → `categories.product.base_path`. If absent, use `.sweetclaude/artifacts/product` as fallback.

**5b: Bootstrap skills.yaml if needed**

Read `.sweetclaude/state/skills.yaml` if it exists.

For each of the six data-owning skills, check whether it is present in `skills.yaml`. Use the following signals to infer state for any missing entry:

| Skill | Artifact signal (file exists → was in use) |
|---|---|
| `product-milestones` | `{base_path}/milestones/MILESTONES-INDEX.md` |
| `product-parking-lot` | `{base_path}/backlog/BACKLOG-INDEX.md` |
| `product-sprint-plan` | *(no inference — write `enabled: false` if absent)* |
| `product-user-personas` | `.sweetclaude/state/personas.yaml` |
| `product-user-stories` | any `US-*.md` under `{base_path}/stories/` |
| `document-corpus` | `.sweetclaude/state/corpus-pipeline.yaml` |

If `skills.yaml` is missing entirely: propose creating it (schema v2) with entries inferred from the above.
If entries are missing from an existing `skills.yaml`: propose adding them with the inferred state.
If `skills.yaml` is schema v1: propose migrating to v2 (same mapping as the update skill's 8e migration step).

> "skills.yaml is missing / has gaps / is schema v1. Based on artifacts on disk: backlog=active, milestones=uninitialized, … Write/migrate it?"

On user approval: write or update `skills.yaml` using atomic write (temp file → rename). Use v2 schema:
- Data file exists → `status: active`, `last_changed_at: {today}`, `last_changed_by: migrated`
- Data file missing → `status: uninitialized`, `last_changed_at: ~`, `last_changed_by: ~`
Do not remove or modify entries that are already present and consistent.

**5c: Flag remaining mismatches**

After bootstrap, re-read `skills.yaml` and check for inconsistencies:

| Situation | Flag |
|---|---|
| `status: active` but no artifacts on disk | "Skill marked active but no artifacts found — partial deletion or failed onboard. Re-run onboard?" |
| `status: uninitialized` or `status: paused` but artifacts clearly exist on disk | "Artifacts found but skill not active — skills.yaml may be stale. Mark active?" |
| `status: paused` — data intact | No flag needed. Paused is an intentional state. |

Propose a fix for each mismatch. Do not auto-apply.

**5d: Offer onboarding for unenabled skills**

After resolving all mismatches, check `skills.yaml` for any skill with `enabled: false`.

If any exist, ask:
> "These skills are not yet set up for this project: {list}. Would you like to onboard any of them now? Enter keywords (e.g. 'milestones backlog') or 'none' to skip."

| Keyword | Skill |
|---|---|
| `milestones` | `product-milestones` |
| `backlog` | `product-parking-lot` |
| `sprint` | `product-sprint-plan` |
| `personas` | `product-user-personas` |
| `stories` | `product-user-stories` |
| `corpus` | `document-corpus` |

For each skill the user enables, invoke it with argument `onboard`. Complete each onboard before starting the next.

**5e: Artifact safety check for deprecated or deleted skills**

Read `skills.yaml`. For any skill with `status: deprecated` or any skill directory present in the installed location but absent from the source (detected via diff), scan artifact paths for live content that would be orphaned.

Use `base_path` from session-state (`paths.product_base`) or fall back to `.sweetclaude/artifacts/product`.

| Skill | Artifact path |
|---|---|
| `product-milestones` | `{base_path}/milestones/MILESTONES-INDEX.md` |
| `product-parking-lot` or `product-backlog` | `{base_path}/backlog/BACKLOG-INDEX.md` |
| `product-sprint-plan` | `{base_path}/sprints/` (any files) |
| `product-user-personas` | `.sweetclaude/state/personas.yaml` |
| `product-user-stories` | `{base_path}/stories/US-*.md` (any files) |
| `document-corpus` | `.sweetclaude/state/corpus-pipeline.yaml` |

If live content is found for a deprecated/deleted skill:

```
⚠ Skill marked deprecated but has live artifact content:
  {skill-name}: {artifact path} — {N} items found

  This content will become orphaned if the skill is removed.
  Inspect before deleting. Run /{skill-name} to review the content.
```

Propose no automatic action — surface only. User decides what to do with the content before any deletion proceeds.

---

## Step 6: Audit registers

Check if SweetClaude's tracking registers have content:
- `.sweetclaude/state/decision-log.md` — any entries?
- `.sweetclaude/state/assumption-register.md` — any entries?
- `.sweetclaude/state/improvement-register.md` — any entries?
- `.sweetclaude/state/scope-changes.md` — any entries?

If all are empty on a project with substantial history:
> "All SweetClaude registers are empty. The project has {N} commits and existing docs. Populate them from git history and existing docs? This gives SweetClaude context about past decisions."

If user says yes, scan git log and existing docs for:
- Decisions: architecture choices, technology selections, scope changes visible in commits
- Assumptions: things implied by the current implementation
- Scope: features that were added or removed based on commit history

Populate as draft entries marked `[retroactive]` for user review.

---

## Step 7: Audit hook registrations

Read `~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/hooks-manifest.json`.

Determine the current project version:
- If `.sweetclaude/state/sweetclaude.yaml` exists: v2
- If `.sweetclaude/state/phase.yaml` exists: v1
- Otherwise: unknown

**7a: Check global hooks (all versions)**

Filter manifest for entries where `required=true` and `scope="global"`. Verify each file is referenced in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os
manifest = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/hooks-manifest.json')))
try:
    settings = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/settings.json')))
except:
    settings = {}
all_cmds = ' '.join(
    h.get('command', '')
    for event_hooks in settings.get('hooks', {}).values()
    for entry in event_hooks
    for h in entry.get('hooks', [])
)
missing = [h for h in manifest['hooks']
           if h.get('required') and h.get('scope') == 'global' and h.get('event') and h['file'] not in all_cmds]
print('\n'.join(f\"{h['file']} ({h['event']})\" for h in missing) if missing else 'OK')
" 2>/dev/null
```

If any required global hooks are missing:
> "These required global hooks are not registered in ~/.claude/settings.json: {list}. Add them?"

If user says yes, add the missing entries to `~/.claude/settings.json` under `hooks.{event}`. For hooks with a non-empty `matcher` (other than `"startup"`), include the matcher field. Write atomically (temp file → rename). Do not remove or modify existing entries. Then say:
> "Global hooks registered in ~/.claude/settings.json. **You need to start a new Claude Code session for these hooks to take effect.** Close this session and open a new one."

```bash
python3 - << 'PY'
import json, os, tempfile
settings_path = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/settings.json')
manifest_path = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/hooks-manifest.json')

with open(settings_path) as f:
    settings = json.load(f)
with open(manifest_path) as f:
    manifest = json.load(f)

all_cmds = ' '.join(
    h.get('command', '')
    for event_hooks in settings.get('hooks', {}).values()
    for entry in event_hooks
    for h in entry.get('hooks', [])
)

hooks_section = settings.setdefault('hooks', {})
for h in manifest['hooks']:
    if not h.get('required') or h.get('scope') != 'global' or not h.get('event') or h['file'] in all_cmds:
        continue
    event = h['event']
    cmd = f"~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/{h['file']}"
    entry = {'hooks': [{'type': 'command', 'command': cmd}]}
    matcher = h.get('matcher', '')
    if matcher and matcher != 'startup':
        entry['matcher'] = matcher
    hooks_section.setdefault(event, []).append(entry)

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w', dir=os.path.dirname(settings_path),
                                  suffix='.tmp', delete=False) as tmp:
    json.dump(settings, tmp, indent=2)
    tmp_name = tmp.name
os.replace(tmp_name, settings_path)
print('OK')
PY
```

**7b: Check project hooks (v2 only)**

Skip entirely for v1 projects — per-project hook registration is a v2 concept.

Filter manifest for entries where `required=true` and `scope="project"`. Verify each file is referenced in `.claude/settings.local.json` in the current project directory.

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os
manifest = json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/hooks-manifest.json')))
project_settings_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '.claude/settings.local.json')
try:
    settings = json.load(open(project_settings_path))
except:
    settings = {}
all_cmds = ' '.join(
    h.get('command', '')
    for event_hooks in settings.get('hooks', {}).values()
    for entry in event_hooks
    for h in entry.get('hooks', [])
)
missing = [h for h in manifest['hooks']
           if h.get('required') and h.get('scope') == 'project' and h.get('event') and h['file'] not in all_cmds]
print('\n'.join(f\"{h['file']} ({h['event']})\" for h in missing) if missing else 'OK')
" 2>/dev/null
```

If any required project hooks are missing:
> "These required project hooks are not registered in .claude/settings.local.json: {list}. Add them?"

If user says yes, add the missing entries to `.claude/settings.local.json` under `hooks.{event}`. Create the file if it does not exist. Write atomically (temp file → rename). Do not remove or modify existing entries.

```bash
python3 - << 'PY'
import json, os, tempfile
project_settings_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '.claude/settings.local.json')
manifest_path = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/hooks-manifest.json')

os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(project_settings_path), exist_ok=True)
try:
    with open(project_settings_path) as f:
        settings = json.load(f)
except:
    settings = {}
with open(manifest_path) as f:
    manifest = json.load(f)

all_cmds = ' '.join(
    h.get('command', '')
    for event_hooks in settings.get('hooks', {}).values()
    for entry in event_hooks
    for h in entry.get('hooks', [])
)

hooks_section = settings.setdefault('hooks', {})
for h in manifest['hooks']:
    if not h.get('required') or h.get('scope') != 'project' or not h.get('event') or h['file'] in all_cmds:
        continue
    event = h['event']
    cmd = f"~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/{h['file']}"
    entry = {'hooks': [{'type': 'command', 'command': cmd}]}
    matcher = h.get('matcher', '')
    if matcher and matcher != 'startup':
        entry['matcher'] = matcher
    hooks_section.setdefault(event, []).append(entry)

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('w', dir=os.path.dirname(project_settings_path),
                                  suffix='.tmp', delete=False) as tmp:
    json.dump(settings, tmp, indent=2)
    tmp_name = tmp.name
os.replace(tmp_name, project_settings_path)
print('OK')
PY
```

> "Project hooks registered in .claude/settings.local.json. **You need to start a new Claude Code session for these hooks to take effect.** Close this session and open a new one."

Also check for hooks referencing `~/.claude/hooks/sweetclaude/` in `~/.claude/settings.json` that have no corresponding entry in `hooks-manifest.json` (unrecognized hooks):
> "settings.json has SweetClaude hook entries not in the manifest: {list}. These may be from a prior install or manually added. Review?"

Only flag — do not remove.

If `hooks-manifest.json` does not exist:
> "hooks-manifest.json is missing from the hooks directory. This file should have been installed with SweetClaude. Run `install.sh` from the SweetClaude repo to restore it."

---

## Step 8: Check for untracked SweetClaude files

Run `git status` on the project. Check if `.sweetclaude/` and `strategy/` have untracked or uncommitted files:

> "These SweetClaude files are not tracked in git: {list}. Commit them?"

---

## Step 9: Report

Present a summary:

```
SweetClaude Config Audit — {project}
═════════════════════════════════════

Phase state:    {✓ correct | ⚠ stale → recommended fix}
CLAUDE.md:      {✓ accurate | ⚠ {N} issues found}
File locations: {✓ correct | ⚠ {N} misplaced artifacts}
Skills / onboard: {✓ in sync | ⚠ {N} mismatches}
Registers:      {✓ populated | ⚠ empty on active project}
Hooks:          {✓ all registered | ⚠ {N} missing | hooks-manifest.json missing}
Git tracking:   {✓ clean | ⚠ {N} untracked files}

→ Proposed fixes: {N}
```

List each proposed fix. Wait for user to approve individually or as a batch.

---

## Rules

- **Propose, do not apply.** Every change needs user approval.
- **Do not move project files without asking.** The user may have reasons for current locations.
- **Retroactive register entries are drafts.** Mark them `[retroactive]` so the user knows they were not captured in real-time.
- **Do not judge the project.** This skill fixes SweetClaude configuration, not project quality.
