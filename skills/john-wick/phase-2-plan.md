# Phase 2: Plan

## P1 — Generate user stories (Autonomous)

Update `current_phase: PLAN` in `john-wick.yaml`.

Invoke `sweetclaude:product-user-stories` with the approved PRD as input. Generate human-readable stories with acceptance criteria. Write to `.sweetclaude/stories/[feature-name]-stories-v1.md`.

Record in `created_artifacts`: `{step: P1, type: stories, path: ..., version: 1}`.
Update `current_step: P2`.

## P2 — Story review caucus (Autonomous)

Run a 2-turn story review caucus with these four personas (pass inline — do not rely on a preset file):

**Personas for story-review:**
- **Product owner**: Acceptance criteria writer for 200+ stories. Flags unmeasurable criteria immediately; biased toward specificity. Rewrites vague criteria as concrete pass/fail tests.
- **Senior engineer**: Full-stack, 12 years. Translates story intent into implementation risk; flags stories that assume impossible interfaces or underspecified data shapes.
- **QA lead**: Test design and exploratory testing. Reads acceptance criteria as test cases; finds the ambiguous cases that will cause test failures.
- **Accessibility reviewer**: WCAG, inclusive design. Ensures stories include accessibility requirements as first-class criteria, not afterthoughts.

Invoke caucus with: stories path, personas above, 2 turns, question: "Are these stories specific enough to write deterministic acceptance tests? Are any acceptance criteria ambiguous, unmeasurable, or missing?"

Write caucus output to `.sweetclaude/caucus/story-review-[YYYYMMDD].md`.
Record in `caucus_outputs`: `{step: P2, path: ...}`.
Update `current_step: P3`.

## P3 — Apply uncontested story adjustments (Autonomous)

Classify caucus findings as uncontested (three or more personas agree, or three agree and one is silent) or contested. Apply uncontested adjustments to the stories document — targeted edits, not a rewrite. Write the change summary to `.sweetclaude/caucus/story-review-[YYYYMMDD]-changes.md`. Record in `caucus_outputs`: `{step: P3, path: ...}`.

Update `current_step: P4`.

## P4 — Generate Gherkin (Autonomous)

For each story in the stories document, invoke `sweetclaude:product-user-tdd-tests` to generate Gherkin `.feature` files. Write to `.sweetclaude/features/[story-slug].feature`. Commit:
```
test: Gherkin specs for {feature_name} stories
```

Record in `created_artifacts`: `{step: P4, type: gherkin, path: .sweetclaude/features/, version: 1}`.
Update `current_step: CK2`.

## CK2 — Plan phase check-in (Conditional)

If `phase_checkins: false`: skip. Update `current_step: DS1`.

If `phase_checkins: true`: invoke `sweetclaude:john-wick-checkin` with:
- `phase=PLAN`
- `question=Is the Gherkin internally consistent and does it cover all PRD success criteria? Are there stories with no Gherkin coverage?`
- `discovery_artifacts={paths from discovery_artifacts in john-wick.yaml}`
- `phase_artifacts={stories path, all .feature file paths}`
- `post_lock=false`

Record output in `checkin_outputs`: `{step: CK2, path: ..., findings: ..., escalated: false}`.

If result is `significant`:
  Set `status: waiting_for_user`, `interactive_gate_pending.step: CK2`, `interactive_gate_pending.description: Gherkin coverage gap — direction needed`.
  Commit: `chore(john-wick): CK2 significant — awaiting gate`.
  Present:
  ```
  JOHN WICK — Plan Phase Check-in Gate
  ══════════════════════════════════════
  CK2 found a gap: [finding]

  Options:
  1. Regenerate Gherkin — re-run P4 with the gap in mind
  2. Proceed anyway — accept the gap and continue to Design
  3. Abort — stop here and review stories manually
  ```
  On user decision:
  - Regenerate: clear `interactive_gate_pending`, set `status: active`, write `current_step: P4`. Increment `created_artifacts` version for the gherkin entry when P4 re-runs.
  - Proceed: clear `interactive_gate_pending`, set `status: active`, write `current_step: DS1`.
  - Abort: set `status: paused`. Stop.

If result is `none` or `minor`: log finding and continue. Update `current_step: DS1`.
