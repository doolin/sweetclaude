# Phase 6: Verify

## V1 — Full test run + report (Autonomous)

Update `current_phase: VERIFY` in `john-wick.yaml`.

Run the complete test suite on the feature branch. Generate a final MD test report (see report-format.md) and append to the aggregate report. If any tests fail: run the severity classifier (see severity-classifier.md). If significant failures: invoke IM2. **V1-specific IM2 behavior:** Fix-and-continue from V1 re-enters at V1 (re-run the full test suite) — do NOT re-enter the IM1 loop. After 2 consecutive Fix-and-continue cycles from V1, IM2 presents only Skip (proceed to V2 with known test failures documented) and Abort options. If not significant: log and continue.

Update `current_step: V2`.

## V2 — Code, security, and compliance review (Autonomous)

Invoke `sweetclaude:code-review` with all three review types: code, security, and compliance.

The compliance review reads `.sweetclaude/state/compliance-context.yaml` automatically (Plan 1 updated this skill). No manual framework specification needed.

Write review output to `.sweetclaude/reports/code-review-[YYYYMMDD].md`.
Record in `created_artifacts`: `{step: V2, type: report, path: ..., version: 1}`.

If any Critical findings in code or security review: set `status: waiting_for_user`, `interactive_gate_pending.step: V2`, `interactive_gate_pending.description: Critical review findings require decision`. Commit: `chore(john-wick): artifacts at V2 — awaiting gate`. Present findings. Wait for user decision before continuing. On response: clear `interactive_gate_pending`, set `status: active`.

Update `current_step: V3`.

## V3 — Update user-facing documentation (Autonomous)

Invoke `sweetclaude:documents-update-docs` for all user-facing documentation affected by the feature. If the skill does not exist: log "sweetclaude:documents-update-docs not found — skipping V3" and continue.

Update `current_step: V4`.

## V4 — Update design documents (Autonomous)

Update all design documents (architecture, tech spec, contract analysis) to reflect the final implementation. These are now post-implementation records, not pre-implementation plans. Increment versions in `created_artifacts` only for entries whose content was actually modified. Commit:
```
docs: update design documents to reflect final {feature_name} implementation
```

Update `current_step: V5`.

## V5 — Cut PR (Interactive)

Update `john-wick.yaml`: set `status: waiting_for_user`, `interactive_gate_pending.step: V5`, `interactive_gate_pending.description: Final PR review`.

Commit any remaining artifacts: `chore(john-wick): artifacts at V5 — awaiting gate`.

Before creating the PR:
1. Verify the current git branch matches `feature_branch` in `john-wick.yaml`: run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If they do not match: halt with "Branch mismatch: current branch is {current}, expected {feature_branch}. Checkout the correct branch before continuing."
2. Check if a PR already exists for this branch: `gh pr view --head {feature_branch} 2>/dev/null`. If one exists, use its URL instead of creating a new one — skip the `gh pr create` step.

Create the final pull request:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "{feature_name}: {one-line description from PRD executive summary}" \
  --base main \
  --head {feature_branch} \
  --body "..."
```

If `gh pr create` fails: set `status: error`, record in `context_checkpoint.notes`, and follow the Error Handling protocol. Do not proceed.

PR description must reference (in order):
1. Approved PRD: `{prd_path}` (version {N})
2. User stories: `{stories_path}`
3. Gherkin specs: `.sweetclaude/features/`
4. Test report (aggregate): `.sweetclaude/reports/test-report-{feature_name}.md`
5. Code review findings: `.sweetclaude/reports/code-review-[YYYYMMDD].md`
6. Compliance frameworks applied: {list from compliance-context.yaml derived_frameworks}
7. Any IM2 escalations that occurred and how they were resolved (list from checkin_outputs where escalated=true)

Present the PR URL to the user:

On user acknowledgment: clear `interactive_gate_pending` (set both `step` and `description` to null). Close the current session: set `sessions[-1].ended` to the current ISO timestamp. Update `john-wick.yaml status: complete`. Record PR URL in `created_artifacts`: `{step: V5, type: pr, path: {url}, version: 1}`.
