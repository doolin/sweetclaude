# SweetClaude

[![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A software development partner for the full project lifecycle — from the first idea through design, implementation, testing, and ship. SweetClaude teaches itself about your project and preferences through conversation, then applies those learnings to deal with the less-fun parts of the project.

SweetClaude works well when structure, traceability, and product thinking over is valued over raw coding speed. It's the wrong tool if you just want to go faster — we suggest [GStack](https://github.com/garry-tan/gstack) if speed is your primary goal. It was built for software development, but has also been used successfully for academic research, product marketing strategy, and other knowledge-intensive work.

Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and an Anthropic subscription.

Run `/sweetclaude:help` and it walks you through what it is, how it works, and whether it's right for your project before touching a single file. You're always in control.



## Key Design Principles

There are too many Claude Code plugins to count. To help you decide if SweetClaude might be helpful for you, here are the principles of SweetClaude's design:

* **Successful projects take more than code.** If you're here you probably already know this, but really thinking through what you're building, for who, why, and how they'll use it results in a good product that delivers value to users. Unfortunately, that part is a lot less fun than vibe-coding — it's real work. SweetClaude is primarily about taking care of that work for you in a structured, reliable way.
* **Hide the complexity**. SweetClaude has over 100 skills built natively on Claude Code's Skills framework and Anthropic's multi-agent architecture. These skills compose into dynamic, situation-driven workflows across four operating modes. Few people want to learn all that.  To hide that complexity, SweetClaude uses a conversational interface with just a few commands as entry points, and an orchestrator skill does the rest (you can also manually invoke most skills if you want).
* **Adapt to user preferences as they evolve.** AI assisted vibe-coding is fantastic for rapid experimentation and iteration to see if an idea is viable. An assistant framework should be able to capture things passively without killing the vibe and then be able to use what it captured to dial up the structure and discipline as needed, based on what it learned in the vibe phase. The framework adjusts to the project, not the other way around.



## Operating Modes

SweetClaude has four operating modes that support everything from vibe-coding hobby projects through enterprise-class B2B product development. It also has one potentially fun mode that isn't recommended for anything that remotely matters - but it is very fast, maybe good for initial prototyping. Those modes are:

* **Flow Mode** — the starting point for any new project or quick experiment. No phases, no gates, no ceremony. SweetClaude observes quietly, builds what you ask, and collects thin artifacts in the background — personas, decisions, scope notes — without interrupting your momentum. When you're ready to dial up the structure, everything it captured is already there. Best for: early-stage exploration, side projects, and any time you need to move fast and figure out what you're building.
* **Kanban** — continuous delivery with one hard rule: no more than three things in progress at once. No sprints, no planning ceremonies, no velocity calculations. Work flows from backlog to done at whatever pace makes sense. SweetClaude enforces the WIP limit and surfaces blocked items before they quietly pile up. Best for: maintenance work, steady feature delivery, and solo developers who want lightweight structure without sprint overhead.
* **Shape Up** — six-week cycles where appetite is fixed and scope is variable. Work starts with a pitch: what problem are we solving, what's the rough shape of the solution, and what won't we build? A betting table decides what gets the next cycle. No backlog grooming, no story points, no carry-over. If it doesn't ship in the cycle, it goes back to the pile. Best for: product-focused work where you want strong scope discipline and a natural forcing function against gold-plating.
* **Agile** — sprint-based delivery with a full planning, execution, and retrospective cycle. Each sprint anchors to a milestone and has an explicit active/closed state — SweetClaude won't let you implement work that isn't in the active sprint. Velocity is tracked on close and feeds into future planning. Best for: projects with defined delivery commitments, multiple contributors, or any situation where stakeholders expect predictable, time-boxed output.
* **John Wick mode** — an experiment at the intersection of vibe-coding and disciplined product development. John Wick mode goes fully autonomous after a short project discovery cycle. Intensely disciplined — TDD Level 3, subagent isolation, QA caucus, hard gates at key decisions. Not for everyday use — but no other mode comes close for maximum automation. Fast, independent, admittedly dangerous - but disciplined. No loose ends. `/sweetclaude:john-wick`

Switch modes at any time with `/sweetclaude:project-mode`. SweetClaude snapshots your current state before any transition.



## Quick Start

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/carson-sweet/sweetclaude
/plugin install sweetclaude@sweetclaude
```

Then go to your project and run:

```
/sweetclaude:go introduce me to sweetclaude
```

**Manual install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carson-sweet/sweetclaude.git
cd sweetclaude && ./install.sh
```



## Basic Usage

Inside Claude Code, the primary command is `/sweetclaude:go`.

Use `/sweetclaude:go` followed by what you want to do, in plain English — "show me milestones and sprints", "let's see the backlog", I want to start building X", "what should I work on next".  Or use `/sweetclaude:go` with no arguments to just pick up where you left off. SweetClaude will ask questions if needed and the orchestrator detects your project state, routes to the right skill, and collaborates with you — it handles the red tape, you do the creating.

You can use SweetClaude to start a new effort from scratch, or have it adopt an existing project. Just point to any documents you might have — backlog, roadmaps, design, etc. — it will assess and migrate what you have and then help you fill in the gaps.

## First Steps

Once SweetClaude is installed, here are some things to try. You'll quickly get oriented.

* `/sweetclaude:help` (this is the single most important first step, you'll get a guided tour)
* `/sweetclaude:go give me a quick overview of what you can do`
* `/sweetclaude:go tell me about the product development lifecycle phases you use`
* `/sweetclaude:go tell me about the differences in flow mode, kanban mode, shape up mode, and agile mode`
* `/sweetclaude:go help me choose the best mode for my project`
* `/sweetclaude:go give me a breakdown of all skills by product lifecycle phase`
* `/sweetclaude:go explain how you would onboard my existing project`
* `/sweetclaude:go tell me about your RAG enabled design and doc management`



## Major Features

- **Discovery-first pipeline** — Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) flow from user and data discovery into architecture and code review automatically — not a checkbox at the end.
- **Compliance-ready from day one** — SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS requirements surface automatically during discovery, not as an afterthought. For regulated industries, SweetClaude produces the artifacts your auditor needs: decision logs, gate records, and traceability maps.
- **Enforced TDD at four levels** — At the highest level, test writer and implementer are separate AI agents. Test files are physically blocked from modification during implementation by hooks. Tests run after every source edit.
- **Persistent phase state** — `.sweetclaude/` tracks phase, decisions, and scope changes in git. Return after weeks and `/sweetclaude:go` re-orients without re-explaining.
- **Mockup pipeline** — Design UI components in an isolated Vite + React sandbox before touching production code. Graduate approved mockups with acceptance criteria extracted automatically.
- **Local semantic search over your design documents** — LanceDB-powered RAG, fully offline, no API keys, no external services. Index your architecture docs, data model, and product decisions so both you and SweetClaude can ask questions and get canonical answers instantly. Setup takes one command.
- **Corpus management** — Four-step pipeline (consolidate → triage → reconcile → promote) for messy document collections. Pairs with local RAG for full document lifecycle management.
- **Behavioral contracts** — 15 behavioral properties tested against each Claude model version. Hook-enforced properties are deterministic; instruction-guided properties are validated by a regression suite.



## How It Works

SweetClaude is a Claude Code plugin. After install, all skills are available as slash commands in every session. Load for a single session with `--plugin-dir` without a global install.

TDD hooks physically block test file modification during implementation and run tests automatically after every source edit. At higher TDD levels, test writer and implementer are separate AI agents — the implementer never sees the spec, only failing tests.

## Common Commands

You can invoke skills directly if you know what you want. These are the most common. You can also refer to the [complete skills reference](docs/user-guide/skills-reference.md).

### Primary Commands
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/sweetclaude:go` | Pick up where you left off. Reads state, checks phase exit criteria, routes to the right skill. Pass plain-English arguments to describe what you want. |
| `/sweetclaude:status` | Project status dashboard — active work item, phase, roadmap, backlog. |
| `/sweetclaude:help` | Conversational help — describe what you want to do, browse features, or ask questions |

### Housekeeping
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/sweetclaude:off` | Suspend SweetClaude — preserves all artifacts, reactivate with `/sweetclaude:go` |
| `/sweetclaude:purge` | Delete all SweetClaude artifacts — recommends a backup branch, shows all files, requires "I understand". **Taking a branch snapshot before is highly recommended.** |
| `/sweetclaude:update` | Fetch latest SweetClaude from GitHub and sync to all projects |
| `/sweetclaude:fix-sweetclaude` | Audit and repair SweetClaude configuration |

### Advanced
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/sweetclaude:behavioral-regression` | Run the 15-contract behavioral test suite — validates that the current model version honors SweetClaude's behavioral contracts. Run after any Claude model upgrade. **15/15 passing on claude-sonnet-4-6 (2026-05-01).** [Contract status by model version →](docs/user-guide/behavioral-contracts.md) · [Full contract list →](skills/behavioral-regression/SKILL.md) |
| `/sweetclaude:guardian-on` | Enable Protocol Guardian — enforces skill invocations and protocol steps for the session |
| `/sweetclaude:guardian-off` | Disable Protocol Guardian |
| `/sweetclaude:session-export` | Export a Claude.ai session as a structured document |
| `/sweetclaude:usage` | View, enable, or disable local usage tracking |

Individual workflow skills (product, design, code, testing, corpus) are accessible directly if you know what you want, but `/sweetclaude:go` routes to all of them automatically.
