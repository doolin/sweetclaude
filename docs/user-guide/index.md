# SweetClaude User Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-05-01

SweetClaude is a software development partner for the full project lifecycle — from the first idea through design, implementation, testing, and ship.

It adapts to your working style. Start with vibe-coding in Flow Mode — no ceremony, no gates. Switch to Kanban, Shape Up, or Agile as the project matures. Or apply full enterprise-class discipline from day one. The framework adjusts to the project, not the other way around. It works with any language because the workflow discipline is the product, not the boilerplate.

> **New to SweetClaude?** Don't start here. Run `/sweetclaude:help` in Claude Code — it teaches itself through conversation and will get you oriented faster than any written doc. Come back to this guide when you need a specific reference.

SweetClaude was built for software development, but has also been used successfully for academic research, product marketing strategy, and other knowledge-intensive work.

This guide is the long form. The README on the front page sells the idea; these pages explain how it actually fits together when you sit down to use it.

## Where to Begin

If you are new and want a working install, read [Getting Started](getting-started.md). It walks you through your first session with sample interactions so you know what to expect when SweetClaude pushes back on your concept or asks you to challenge an assumption.

If you have it installed and want to understand the design decisions — why phases instead of a single linear flow, why TDD is enforced by hooks instead of asked-for in prompts, why SweetClaude refuses to estimate timelines — read [How It Works](how-it-works.md).

If you have a specific situation ("I have a messy pile of strategy docs," "I need to ship a hotfix," "I am adopting an existing codebase"), jump to [Walkthroughs](walkthroughs.md). Each scenario is end-to-end with the commands and what comes back.

If you are looking up a specific skill or phase, the [Skills Reference](skills-reference.md), [Phases and Workflows](phases-and-workflows.md), [TDD Levels](tdd.md), and [State and Memory](state-and-memory.md) pages are the lookups.

If you are deciding whether SweetClaude is the right tool for what you are doing, the [FAQ](faq.md) is honest about when it is and is not.

## What Is in This Guide *(reference documentation)*

| Page | What it is |
|---|---|
| [Getting Started](getting-started.md) | A tutorial. Install through your first feature. Includes sample interactions so you can recognize the rhythm. |
| [How It Works](how-it-works.md) | The mental model. Why two-dimensional state, why phase dwelling, why deference levels, what survives a crash. |
| [Walkthroughs](walkthroughs.md) | Six concrete scenarios end-to-end. New product from a napkin sketch, hotfix, doc pile, course correction, existing repo, building one feature with full TDD. |
| [Phases and Workflows](phases-and-workflows.md) | Reference for the 7 phases, 6 workflow shapes, 19 work types, hard and soft gates, progressive disclosure by version stage. |
| [Skills Reference](skills-reference.md) | All skills with invocation, purpose, and common combinations. |
| [TDD Levels](tdd.md) | The four enforcement levels and the design choice underneath them. Why hooks, not prompts. |
| [State and Memory](state-and-memory.md) | What lives in `.sweetclaude/`, how it survives sessions, what to commit. |
| [Corpus and RAG](corpus-system.md) | Document pipeline (consolidate → triage → reconcile → promote) and local semantic search. |
| [FAQ](faq.md) | Honest answers. When SweetClaude is the right tool. When it is not. |

## A Note on Voice

Throughout these pages you will see SweetClaude take positions. It thinks unbounded autonomous coding agents are bad ideas without phase gates. It thinks tests and implementations should be written by separate contexts so neither can rationalize away the other. It refuses to give time estimates because AI-assisted development does not run on calendar time.

This is by design. SweetClaude is opinionated software with a workflow that came from one person building things and finding out which steps could be skipped without consequences and which ones could not. The opinions are documented here so you can take them, leave them, or argue with them — but you will not have to guess what they are.

## Quick Reference

```
/sweetclaude:go     Pick up where you left off — routes to the right skill automatically
/sweetclaude:status Project status — active work, roadmap, backlog
/sweetclaude:help   Conversational help — explains SweetClaude, walks through modes and phases, helps you decide where to start
```

`/sweetclaude:go` reads state, detects where you are (setup needed, work in flight, phase exit criteria), and routes to the right skill. You can also pass plain-English arguments: `/sweetclaude:go pick up where I left off`, `/sweetclaude:go I want to work on the auth flow`.

All workflow skills are documented in the [Skills Reference](skills-reference.md). You rarely need to memorize commands — `/sweetclaude:go` routes to all of them automatically.
